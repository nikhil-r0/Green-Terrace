# Green Terrace

## Overview
**Green Terrace** is an application designed for terrace farmers, both beginners and experienced gardeners. Our app leverages weather data from the user's location and a custom plant dataset to provide personalized farming suggestions. Whether you're growing flowers, vegetables, or fruits, Green Terrace tailors a farming plan just for you. The app also features a marketplace for buying or selling produce and tools, and a community space for sharing knowledge, guides, and tutorials. It connects users with nurseries, markets, and researchers, fostering a supportive ecosystem for terrace farming.

## Key Features
- **Personalized Crop Recommendations**: Based on local weather and a custom dataset, we suggest the best crops for your terrace garden.
- **Marketplace**: A platform for buying and selling produce, plants, and gardening tools.
- **Community Space**: Access tutorials, share your gardening journey, and connect with nurseries and researchers for additional support.
- **Prototype ML Model**: The recommendation model currently runs locally due to limited cloud deployment options.

## Current Development Status
- **Under Development**: Green Terrace is a work in progress, with many features still being built.
- **Placeholders**: Most marketplace functionalities, such as buying and selling items, are placeholders in this version and not fully operational.
- **ML Model Deployment**: The recommendation system is not functional due to the prototype model running locally on laptops. Contact us to manually run the model.

## Future Development Plans
1. **Image-Based Recommendations**: Use terrace or garden space images for more precise suggestions.
2. **Chatbot Integration**: Provide an AI-based assistant to guide users with personalized advice.
3. **Crop Tracking**: Monitor crop health and progress to improve yield predictions.
4. **Full Cloud Deployment**: Move the model to cloud infrastructure once access is granted.
5. **Enhanced Marketplace**: Expand functionality to enable real transactions and integrate with nurseries and suppliers.
